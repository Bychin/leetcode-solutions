# LeetCode Solutions

## Description:
This repository is dedicated to storing my own solutions for various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. As an enthusiastic coder and problem solver, I have embarked on the exciting journey of mastering algorithms and data structures by tackling LeetCode challenges.

Also instead of jumping from one algorithm concept to another and getting stuck in a learning-without-progress cycle I use [NeetCode roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) to guide my journey.

## Purpose of this Repository:
The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal coding journal, where I document my journey through LeetCode challenges. By solving these problems and organizing my solutions, I aim to improve my problem-solving abilities, sharpen my algorithmic knowledge, and enhance my coding proficiency in various programming languages.

## Repository Structure:
### 1. /problems
The "problems" directory contains subdirectories for each LeetCode problem I have attempted. Each problem directory name pattern is: `ID_problem-name`, where `ID` is a problem ID and `problem-name` is a part of corresponding URL to a problem (`https://leetcode.com/problems/problem-name/`).

### 2. /utils
The "utils" directory contains any custom utility functions or data structures that I find useful while solving LeetCode problems. These utilities aid in code reusability and make the solutions more concise and maintainable.
